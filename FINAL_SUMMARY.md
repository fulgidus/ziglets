**Date**: May 30, 2025  
**Project**: Ziglets - A collection of simple Zig CLI applications  
**Repository**: `fulgidus/ziglets`

## ✅ **SETUP COMPLETE** - All Systems Ready

Your **Ziglets** project now has a fully functional, professional-grade CI/CD pipeline that follows industry best practices. Here's what has been implemented:

---

## 🏗️ **CI/CD Infrastructure**

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **🔍 CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - ✅ Multi-platform testing (Linux, Windows, macOS)
  - ✅ Code formatting validation (`zig fmt`)
  - ✅ Cross-compilation for 9 target architectures
  - ✅ Documentation verification
  - ✅ Triggers on push/PR to main and develop branches

- **🚀 Release Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
  - ✅ Semantic versioning validation (v*.*.*)
  - ✅ Multi-platform builds (9 architectures)
  - ✅ Automated GitHub Releases with checksums
  - ✅ Professional release notes generation
  - ✅ Only triggers on tagged commits

### Target Platforms (9 Architectures)
| Platform | Architecture | Toolchain | Status |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Linux    | x86_64      | GNU/MUSL  | ✅ Ready |
| Linux    | ARM64       | GNU/MUSL  | ✅ Ready |
| Windows  | x86_64      | GNU/MSVC  | ✅ Ready |
| Windows  | ARM64       | GNU       | ✅ Ready |
| macOS    | x86_64/ARM64| Native    | ✅ Ready |
